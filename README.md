# Decision-Tree-Classification
Decision tree classification is a machine learning technique that uses a decision tree to classify data into different classes or categories.
The decision tree classification algorithm builds a tree-like model from the training data, where each internal node represents a feature or attribute, each branch represents a decision rule based on the feature values, and each leaf node represents the class label or outcome. The goal is to create a tree that partitions the data into homogeneous subsets, where instances belonging to the same class are grouped together.
The decision tree continues to split the data until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a maximum tree depth, achieving a minimum number of instances in each leaf node, or when no further improvement in purity can be achieved. At the end, the resulting tree provides a set of decision rules that can be used to classify new, unseen instances.
Decision tree classification offers several advantages- Interpretability, Handling categorical and numerical data, Capturing non-linear relationships and interactions,Handling missing values
However, decision tree classification also has some limitations - Overfitting, Lack of robustness, Biased towards features with more levels
Decision tree classification is widely used in various fields, including healthcare, finance, customer segmentation, and fraud detection. Its simplicity, interpretability, and ability to handle complex relationships make it a valuable tool for solving classification problems.
